<p style="color:#7c89a0;">Cotton candy is a sugar confection that is light and fluffy like a cloud. In the beginning, it was called fairy floss and it was said to have originated since the Renaissance. A dentist named Josef Lauscaux coined the name we used today, cotton candy, in the 1920s. The reason behind the name was because the candy reminded him of cotton in the state he was from, which was Louisiana.
